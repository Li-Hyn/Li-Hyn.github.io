Hi, I'm a nlp researcher at Antgroup. My research interest includes LLMs, Natural Language Processing, and Data mining.

I received degree of B.E. (with honors, Hongshen Honors School, 2021) in computer science and technology at [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) and I received degree of M.S. in AI at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

In my master’s study, I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Lefei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BLKHwNwAAAAJ) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University, [Dr. Liang Ding]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BLKHwNwAAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lFCLvOAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)) from University of Sydney, and [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) from Nanyang Technological University. Deep appreciate!

Currently, I am working on research projects mainly about LLMs, especially on the filed of Reinforcement Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting. Feel free to email me for any form of discussion.
