Hi, I'm a nlp researcher at Antgroup. My research interest includes LLMs, Natural Language Processing, and Data mining.

I received degree of B.E. (with honors, Hongshen Honors School, 2021) in computer science and technology at [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) and I received degree of M.S. in AI at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

In my master’s study, I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Lefei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BLKHwNwAAAAJ) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University. 

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

Currently, I am working on research projects mainly about LLMs, especially on the filed of Data-centric study and Catastrophic Forgetting study. Feel free to email me for any form of discussion.
